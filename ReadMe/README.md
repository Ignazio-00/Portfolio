## About

I want to build a dynamic and interactive portfolio website. It should display the work that I have done in the Online Marketing sector. It should also be informative, mainly about an online advertisement for small businesses and why it is so important to be visible online. Therefore I want to implement several different buttons that show information about myself. In terms of the MVP, there should be images on the landing page, different fonts and colors, and a contact Formula.
